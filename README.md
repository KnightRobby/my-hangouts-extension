My Hangouts for Google+ Chrome Extension
---------------------------------------

Are you looking for an extension that will allow you to see all the active hangouts
in your stream? Then this is the extension for you.

It will allow you to quickly view all of the active hangouts just by clicking the
browser action icon that will be located in the toolbar on the corner next to the
wrench. Just click the icon, and a list will then appear with all of the active
hangouts. Then you just hover over the total number of participants to see who
is active in the hangout. Finally, click on the blue "Join" button to automatically
switch over to the new hangout.

Active hangouts will have a blue icon while inactive hangouts will have a grey
icon with a question mark.

Donations
----------

 - Many people have asked me for donations, but I rather code for fun and releasing
   extensions that the users want. Everything I do is OpenSource and I enjoy it
   to be that way because this is how I learned Software Development. 
 - I decided to place a PayPal donation link here, so if you would like to donate
   to support my Open Source development, you can visit the PayPal donations link
   here http://goo.gl/Mr2vX
